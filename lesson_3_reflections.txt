When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you're working on the same code
with another person or sharing it with a larger group.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not agree with whatever changes are made to your GitHub, so if Git
automatically pulls changes, it might mess up what you were working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are in between different github accounts in which you can copy over what
another person has and work on it without messing up the original. Clones copy
what's on github into your local device(your computer). Branches are in between
different versions of the file on your local device.
