What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

If you initialize a repository, a hidden repository is formed which tracks all
of the history and metadata of the file. You need to do it so that you have a
place to track all of your work and create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area combines all the files that needs to be committed so unnecessary
commits aren't made combining large amounts of data. It offers a separate area
to collect all the files you want.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use git status to check which files are in the staging area and then
decide whether the files you have are logical. Also, you could move each file to
the staging area whenever you logically change it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

If you want to create an experimental line of code or add another version to the
code without changing the original, branches would be helpful. It allows you to
make changes to the code without affecting the main version.
